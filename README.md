## Pytest-Testing-word-matching function - basic, edge cases and negative testing
 Consider the following function:

### Function: count_word_matches
The function will:

 1. Accept two inputs: a string (text) and a single word (target).

 2. Count how many times the target word appears as a standalone word in the text string (case-insensitive).

 3. Return the count.

### Implementation   Function is found in the main.py file.

### Explanation of the Function:
 1. Word Matching:A "standalone word" is defined as a sequence of characters separated by spaces. ◦ Matching is case-insensitive (e.g., "Cat" matches "cat").

 2. Input Handling: The function splits the input text into words using spaces as delimiters. ◦ If either text or target is empty, it returns 0.

 3. Counting: Uses Python’s list.count() to count exact matches of the target word in the list of words.

### Exercise 1: Basic Parameterized Tests ###
Use parameterization to test count_word_matches with multiple input combinations of text and target, along with their expected outputs. Write a parameterized test to validate the function across basic, mixed-case, and simple edge-case scenarios. Implemented test cases are found in the test_count_word_matches_basic.py file.

### Test Cases: ###
1. text="The cat sat on the mat", target="cat" → Expect 1 (Only "cat" matches, not "cat" in "concatenate").
2. text="Dog dog DOG dOg", target="dog" → Expect 4 (Case-insensitive matches).
3. text="Hello world", target="world" → Expect 1.
4. text="hello hello HELLO", target="hello" → Expect 3.
5. text="No matches here", target="yes" → Expect 0 (No matches).
6. text="catcat cat catdog", target="cat" → Expect 1 (Only standalone "cat" counts, not "cat" in "catcat").
7. text="a a a", target="a" → Expect 3.

### Exercise 2: Edge Case Testing ###
Test the count_word_matches function using parameterized tests. Focus on empty inputs, spaces, and punctuation. Implemented test cases are found in the test_count_word_matches_edge_cases.py file.

### Test Cases: ###
1. Empty Text: text="", target="word" → Expect 0.
2. Empty Target: text="hello world", target="" → Expect 0.
3. Both Empty: text="", target="" → Expect 0.
4. Multiple Spaces: text="hello  world", target="world" → Expect 1 (Extra spaces ignored).
5. Leading/Trailing Spaces: text=" cat ", target="cat" → Expect 1.
6. Punctuation Not Handled: text="cat,dog cat", target="cat" → Expect 1
7. Single Character: text="x y z", target="x" → Expect 1.

### Exercise 3: Negative Testing ###
Test the function for invalid inputs like None, integers, or lists to ensure it raises the appropriate exceptions. Implemented test cases are found in the test_count_word_matches_negative.py file.

### Test Cases: ###
1. None Text: text=None, target="word" → Expect a TypeError.
2. None Target: text="hello world", target=None → Expect a TypeError.
3. Integer Text: text=123, target="word" → Expect a TypeError.
4. Integer Target: text="hello world", target=456 → Expect a TypeError.
5. List Text: text=["hello", "world"], target="world" → Expect a TypeError.
6. List Target: text="hello world", target=["world"] → Expect a TypeError.

### How to run the tests: ###
1. First install PyTest in the PyCharm environment Installing PyTest

 '''Run the following command in the terminal of PyCharm:
     pip install pytest'''
     
2. Then execute the tests Run the following command in the terminal of PyCharm: pytest -v or pytest
